**However, let's see how far you've gone by this first problem**

A frog wants to cross a river that is `11 feet across`.

There are `10 stones` in a line leading across the river, `separated by 1 foot`, and the frog is only ever able to jump `one foot` forward to the next stone, or `two feet` forward to the stone after the next. 

`In how many different ways can he jump exactly 11 feet to the other side of the river?`

For example, **one way** to cross would be `1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1` with 1 representing the frog moving 1 foot forward to the next stone, and 2 representing the frog jumping over one stone, moving 2 feet forward.

Keep in mind that the `total distance` jumped must be `11 feet`, so when the frog has traveled ten feet to the last stone, it is only allowed to make a one foot hop.
