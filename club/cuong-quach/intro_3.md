### You seem to have some basic understanding about Algorithms

#### Let's see how well you do with a "less basic" question

Suppose you are given a sorted array with 1000 integers, and you can only use at most n
comparisons to determine whether a certain number is in this array.

What is the optimal value of n? 
- The optimal value of n in this case is the smallest value possible of n so that you don't have to compare more than n times to find out if a certain number is in this array.
