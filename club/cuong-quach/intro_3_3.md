### We have been playing around with some very basic algorithms

#### Let's now review some basic data structures that you might have learnt from college

You have a stack with 20 elements and a queue with 35 elements, for a total of 55 elements. 
Then you perform the following code 80 times:

```
enqueue(pop())
push(dequeue())
```

How many of the 55 total elements are involved in the process of inserting and 
removing an element into and out of the stack/queue? 

That is how many distinct elements from the stack and the queue get 
`enqueued, popped, pushed, or dequeued`? 

Please note this is `not` asking how many `times` elements move but how many `elements` move.
